      <p style="font-family: cursive">The bright natural phenomena that lights up the sky at the magnetic poles of the Earth are known as the Aurora Borealis
           (Northern Lights) and Aurora Australis (Southern Lights). These so called “light shows” are heavily influenced by the
            geomagnetic field around the Earth and produce a variety of colors depending on the type of air molecules these particles 
            collide with. For example, particle collision with oxygen molecules exhibit yellow and green colors while interaction with
             nitrogen produce red, violent, and blue colors. However, to better understand the nature of the auroras, it is important to
              understand the physics behind the magnetic field of the earth and its influence on the charged particles that make up this 
              phenomenon.</p>

          <p style="font-family: cursive">As the energetic particles from the sun penetrate the ionosphere, they interact with the atmospheric molecules, such as 
              oxygen, and “excite” their atomic state. These ionized molecules then jump back to their ground state and emit electromagnetic 
              waves in the form of visible light that would makeup up the auroras. However, before the particles enter the ionosphere, they 
              have to get past the magnetosphere. Keep in mind that the magnetic field of the Earth acts as a shield that deflects particles 
              from the solar wind as well as cosmic rays from locations outside the solar system. Even though most of the particles are 
              deflected, some manage to enter the magnetosphere. The electrons and protons swirl around the magnetic field lines and 
              eventually interact with the atmospheric molecules at the poles.</p>

              <p style="font-family: cursive"> Recall that when the particles travel with respect to the magnetic field, they accelerate and swirl around the field lines. In a 
                  simple case, if a charged particle with a velocity moves perpendicular to the magnetic field, it will follow a helical pathway with a 
                  force pointing radially inward. This motion is called cyclotron motion. However, in this situation, the particles do not move perpendicular
                   to the magnetic field since it is moving towards the poles of the earth. Instead, these charges move at an angle in the direction of the
                    magnetic field where it continues to follow a helical pathway. The radius of the cyclotron motion changes as the particle travels through
                     Earth’s magnetic field. This can be depicted mathematically as: r=mv/qB , where r is the radius, m is the mass of the particle, v is 
                     the velocity at which it is moving, q is the charge, and B is the magnetic field. Note that the magnetic field strength is the strongest
                      at the north and south poles.</p>
              <p style="font-family: cursive">Since the magnetic field increases as the particles move closer to these poles, the radius of its motion 
                  decreases since both share an inverse relationship. The radius of the particle’s motion is the greatest when it enters the 
                  magnetosphere and gradually decreases till it reaches the poles where it is the smallest. The frequency of the particles motion also 
                  changes as the particles moves along the magnetosphere. The frequency of the particle can be described as: f=qB/2πm , where f is the 
                  frequency of the particle, q is the charge, B is the magnetic field, and m is the mass of the particles. The particles circle faster
                   as it approaches the magnetic poles because the frequency is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength. As stated before,
                    once the particles interact with the air molecules in the ionosphere, electromagnetic waves in the form of visible light is produced.
                     These lights at the geographical poles of the Earth are known as the Auroras.</p>
